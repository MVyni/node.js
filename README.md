ðŸš€ Learning Repository: Node.js

This repository is dedicated to my studies on Node.js, as part of the **Rocketseat** bootcamp.

Here, I'm committing all my progress, from the most basic concepts to more advanced topics like API creation and the use of frameworks.

 ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The main goal of this project is to document and track my learning journey in Node.js. Each commit represents a new concept or the evolution of a project, serving as a record and a way to review the content I've learned.

 ðŸ’» Technologies Used

 **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
 **npm/yarn**: Package manager.

## âœ… Next Steps

My next steps will include:

* [ ] Structuring the application with routes and controllers using Fastify, Knex, TypeScript, and other technologies.
